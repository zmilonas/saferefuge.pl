With the educational project, we respond to a call for support that we received from the members of a Student’s Union at 
the Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture. Young architects from Ukraine are in great need of a 
specialised course on the topics related to the reconstruction of their country in peacetime.

<br>

Project Safe Refuge, in collaboration with a student union from Wrocław University of Science and Technology, supports 
the University of Universities in creating a curriculum for a semester-long online course directed to young Ukrainian 
architects to help them develop their skills and knowledge about reconstruction. The course will start in September. 
As an introduction to the project, we invite international students to prepare presentations about historical case 
studies of the reconstruction of cities, which will be presented during an online event with students from Ukraine.

<br>

We call architecture and building technology professionals to contribute to the transfer of knowledge and join the 
course organised by the University of Universities with our help. Please consider joining as lecturers or external 
experts during a review of design projects. Participation in the course will be an important sign of support from the 
international architectural community for our colleagues in Ukraine. It is relevant to build hope in the young 
generation of architects and engineers and to equip them with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle the complex 
challenges related to large-scale reconstruction, which they will face at the beginning of their careers.

<br>

We believe that citizens of Ukraine should remain responsible for making key decisions related to the recovery of their 
country, such as the design and rebuilding of their cities, choice of materials, and architectural expression and they 
must operate on their own in peacetime. We want to support them in this process through a transfer of knowledge. We call 
the international community of experts to join the project.

contribute to the course, please send us your CV and a short proposal for a lecture topic to
