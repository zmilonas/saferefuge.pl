With the educational project, we respond to a call for support that we received from the members of the Student’s Union 
at the Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture. Young architects from Ukraine are in great need of a 
specialised course on the topics related to the reconstruction of their country in peacetime.


<br>

Project Safe Refuge, in collaboration with a student association from Wrocław University of Science and Technology
, supports the University of Universities in creating a curriculum for a semester-long online course directed to young 
Ukrainian architects. The aim of the workshop is to help students from Ukraine in developing their skills and knowledge 
about reconstruction. As an introduction to the project, we invite international students to prepare presentations about 
historical case studies of the reconstruction of cities, which will be presented during an online event with students 
from Ukraine.

<br>

We call architecture and building technology professionals to contribute to the transfer of knowledge and join the 
course organised by the University of Universities. Please consider joining as lecturers or external experts for a 
design review session. Participation in the course will be an important sign of support from the international 
architectural community for our colleagues in Ukraine. It is relevant to build hope in the young generation of 
architects and engineers and to equip them with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle the complex challenges 
related to large-scale reconstruction, which they will face at the beginning of their careers.

**why?**
<div class="ml-10">

<br>

We believe that citizens of Ukraine should remain responsible for making key decisions related to the recovery of their 
country, including those related to the design and rebuilding of their cities, choice of materials, and architectural 
expression. We want to support them in this process through a transfer of knowledge. We invite the international 
community of experts to join the project.
