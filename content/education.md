Young architects from Ukraine are in great need of a specialised course on the topics related to the reconstruction of 
their country in peacetime. Project Safe Refuge, in collaboration with a student association from Wroc≈Çaw University of 
Science and Technology, wants to contribute to creating a program of workshops to help students from Ukraine in 
developing their skills and knowledge about reconstruction. As an introduction to the project, we invite international 
students to prepare presentations about historical case studies of the reconstruction of cities, which will be presented 
during an online event with students from Ukraine. The course will be an important sign of support from the 
international architectural community for our colleagues in Ukraine. It is relevant to build hope in the young 
generation of architects and engineers and to equip them with the skills and knowledge necessary to tackle the complex 
challenges related to large-scale reconstruction, which they will face at the beginning of their careers.

**why?**

<br>

We believe that citizens of Ukraine should remain responsible for making key decisions related to the recovery of their 
country, including those related to the design and rebuilding of their cities, choice of materials, and architectural 
expression. We want to support them in this process through a transfer of knowledge.
