<br>

We develop a solution for transitional housing which could be easily produced and installed in countries facing housing 
crises to host the refugees. Once the war ends such affordable, mobile and modular units should also be transported to 
Ukraine, to empower those who will be rebuilding Ukraine. To act quickly and efficiently, we are exploring possibilities 
of adapting and improving existing solutions. We believe such projects should be developed in collaboration with 
manufacturers, engineers and entrepreneurs from the early stage. To help efficiently, we need to be focused on bringing 
our innovation to mass production capability in a short time frame. Because of that, we are developing concepts to 
optimise, improve and adapt existing solutions.

<br> 

Existing shelter solutions rarely take into account psychological, social and cultural needs. Our main focus is on 
participatory processes, through which we want to embrace those needs and translate them to design solutions. The user 
group is the current humanitarian crisis currently consists mostly of women, children and elderly people, while after 
the war ends the unit will be likely to host reunited families and extended families. There is also a need to understand 
the cultural specificities of that group, to help them feel at home. We feel that for an adequate response, learning from 
the residents of Ukraine in a participatory process is necessary.

<br> 

Tents, containers and other solutions most often used in humanitarian response are temporary solutions, which are not 
sustainable from an environmental, social or economical point of view. With the advancement of technology and knowledge
on sustainability, we propose to use solutions for affordable, mobile, transitional housing units which already exist in
the market and adapt them to host refugees. With a closer collaboration of humanitarian architects with the private sector,
environmentally friendly solutions can become affordable and quickly assembled. Transitional housing, with a longer intended
life cycle, is a solution which offers more dignity and improved living conditions for the refugees, compared to the
temporary solutions. When no longer needed, mobile and modular solutions can later be repurposed for other functions.

<br> 

To make the structure sustainable from the economic point of view, our design group proposes solutions using clusters
of units and indicates in the strategies for the municipalities which other facilities like workspaces, infrastructure,
education and community buildings are needed. We want to provide designer assistance not only in proposing sheltering 
solutions but also in creating sustainable neighbourhoods.

<br> 

There is a need to adapt the existing solutions to the challenges of the climate, particularly harsh winters with heavy
snow. Our solutions will help to adapt the existing products to the demands of the local climate in Ukraine and neighbouring 
countries.

We believe that participatory processes and prototyping are crucial for the first months of our initiative. Our first
step is organising two editions of workshops with refugees from Ukraine - in the Netherlands, with the support of TU Delft,
and in Poland. We designed a programme for workshops with adults and with kids and established contacts with interested 
participants. Together with them, we want to understand the community needs and the challenges of the local climate, and 
test our design ideas through 1:1 prototypes. From the early stage, we want to inform the research and design with the
knowledge that we can only get through checking the materials, connections, dimensions, organisation of space and 
construction techniques in the real world.
