The Adaptive Reuse team aims to support cities hosting refugees in developing responses to housing crises and work 
directly with municipalities to plan strategies for adaptive reuse of abandoned and underused buildings. We offer remote 
support with evaluation and assessment of opportunities and challenges, preliminary design, expert consultations for local 
architects, research, and advocacy for local and global messages. We are up to date with the latest design and technological 
solutions from many different countries, including those that have already been facing challenges related to integrating new
residents in the hosting cities. We offer help from our team of volunteers to local architects and communities.
Together we can rethink design solutions to propose projects for safe, healthy and liveable neighbourhoods.

Local governments and municipal authorities in the countries hosting refugees are facing unprecedented tasks related to
the need to accommodate thousands of refugees fleeing from the war in Ukraine. Being aware of the pre-existing problem with
housing supply in many cities, we offer our designer assistance and willingness to support the development of new housing
projects through the adaptation of abandoned or underused buildings. We develop strategies for designing housing solutions 
for refugees and people excluded from market tenancies, to avoid potential social tensions arising from preferential treatment 
of refugees or the creation of closed isolated communities. 

<br>

As part of this project, we want to develop a set of good design practices that take into account not only the highest 
standards of architectural and urban design but also the differences arising from geographic and regional location and legal
and ownership issues regarding land. At the moment, we have identified two potential scenarios of action: the modernisation 
and adaptation of vacant residential buildings to conditions allowing safe and dignified living, and the readaptation of 
buildings with industrial and service to residential functions. We develop a transitional solution of a lightweight and 
affordable structure which could be implemented to empty office space to temporarily adapt it for housing.

At this moment of rapid change, we need to think of systemic solutions and a strategy for upgrading the cities
in a longer perspective with adequate housing, urban infrastructure and opportunities for residents. We hope our effort
to help local architects with the assessment of opportunities through preliminary design and consultation during the 
development of the design process can facilitate the implementation of solutions that will be sustainable from the 
environmental, social and economic points of view.
